Observations:
Long term pathing isn't all that useful vs short term. And it's not directly useful for immediate offensive tactics.


Offensive:
Tactics idea: Instead of attacking enemies with navigation every turn, go for area in vicinity to regroup.
But setting it to position makes sure they go there even when enemies are lost.
