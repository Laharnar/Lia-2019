Observations:
Long term pathing isn't all that useful vs short term. And it's not directly useful for immediate offensive tactics.


Offensive:
Tactics idea: Instead of attacking enemies with navigation every turn, go for area in vicinity to regroup.
But setting it to position makes sure they go there even when enemies are lost.

Currently done:
-Scouting groups.
Description 3.2.19: spread out over the map width, and scan it in 1 wave.

Their purpose is to find the enemy
-Offensive groups.[Rename hunter]
Description 3.2.19: attack random visible enemy, fire if any enemy is visible.
Their purpose is to find a single unit and quickly dispatch it.

Map analyzation: where is the best to go. walls to use, corners, small edges for camping

Grand strategies: predict, reinforce, medical, tactical retreat, for security.
WHAT would be best to happen in the future.

Strategy: camp, regroup, rush, scout, hunt. reorganization of units, positioning.
No direct control over firing and moving.
WHAT should be happening now with the group.

Tactic:Engage free, snipe, spread, search-turn, burst and run, place at wall.
Movement control and custom firing moves
HOW is it happening now in the group.

Sensors: Anaylzation of unit's visuals separately and all units and single group separately.
WHERE should we go?

Micro: In-combat minimial movement changes, like not firing when allies in front, hiding behind walls,
avoiding bullets, just tanking.
HOW should an individual treat itself.

Out of combat:
Movement flow: navigate around the map
